	<h1> Lab 8: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
	<div id="output">
		<p> Hi my name is Heaven</p>
		 </div>
		 <button onClick="javascript:main()">Click Me!</button>

	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> Our first task was to create an index.html for lab 8. The second task was to create a JavaScript file. Within this we had
				to include a comment block at the top of our program. Create two elements for example a button. Final this is to of course
				test, debug and upload.</p>

	<h2> Problems</h2>
		<p> When completing this lab Task 2 became difficult for me. I could not get the button to show up but I then realized I had to
				input it into the index.html</p>

	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results can be seen on this page. The way I was able to complete this lab was through w3schools schools
				and youtube.</p>
