	<h1> Lab 7: Anon Funtion and Callbacks</h1>
	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The goal of this lab is to create an index.html for Lab 7. Experiment with
				the map function using callback funtion, and create a Javascript file</h2>
	<h2> Problems</h2>
		<p> For me personally, nothing was working. I don't know if I didn't link everything correctly.
			I need more help with this. Doing it in class helps but possibly going slower would help a lot more
			since coding is not my strong suit.</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results can be seen on this page. The results of the Javascript creating & callback
				functions can be shown in the console and screenshots</p>
